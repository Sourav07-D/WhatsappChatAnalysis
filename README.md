# WhatsApp Chat Data Analysis

This GitHub repository contains a data analysis project focused on WhatsApp chat data. The project aims to extract valuable insights and trends from chat transcripts using Python-based data analysis tools.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze WhatsApp chat data and visualize the findings to uncover patterns and trends. The analysis is carried out using various Python libraries and the results are presented using Streamlit for an interactive experience.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess and clean the raw chat data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Extract and compute key statistics from the chat data.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the data using:
  - **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting.
  - **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical plots.
  - **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Use Streamlit to display the analysis in an interactive web application.

## Libraries Used

- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For static plotting.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plotting.
- **Streamlit**: For creating interactive web applications.
